you need to add this amount to totalPaid and then calculate the remaining balance from the difference of totalPaid and cartTotal and return the remaining balance and also empty the cart and reset totalPaid variable to 0 if remaining >= (i.e totalPaid is more than cartTotal).
Mentor suggestions:
function pay (amount) {
// Add the current payment amount to the total Paid varia totalPaid + .....;
// Calculate the difference between the totalPaid and th let remaining =
...
// Check if the remaining amount is greater than or equa if (remaining >= 0) {
}
// If so, reset the total Paid to zero to prepare i // payment, as the current payment is enough to cove totalPaid = ...;
emptyCart()
// Return the remaining (negative if payment is less tha return
;
}
*/
/* Create a function named pay that takes in an amount as an argument
  - pay will return a negative number if there is a remaining balance
  - pay will return a positive number if money should be returned to customer */
/* Function to handle the payment process
   - Takes in `amount` as an argument, representing the payment amount
   - Adds `amount` to `totalPaid`
   - Calculates the remaining balance by finding the difference between `totalPaid` and `cartTotal`

   - If payment is insufficient, it returns the remaining balance as a negative number */
